# PHP Contact Form
**A simple one page contact form implemented using PHP with Regular Expression (regex) validation and some CSS styling.**

I have noticed this question asked a number of times in some developer groups on Facebook, WhatsApp, forums, etc. I usually feel lazy to respond because I feel it would be a lengthy response, so I have finally decided to create this repository in case I ever need to respond to such a question or even better, if someone stumbles upon it and they find it helpful or share some improvements.

##Scenario
So, let's say you have created your website, maybe a portfolio website using HTML or PHP, with a couple of pages such as Home, About, Portfolio and Contact. You have created a beautiful form on your Contact page with fields such as Name, Phone, Email and Query.

##Problem
You have this beautiful form, but you are not really sure how to make it work.

##Possible Solution
There are several waysin which one can get feedback or queries submitted using such a form. What I will be sharing is a solution that:

1. Validates user input; Name, Phone, Email and Query fields using Regular Expressions (regex),
2. Highlights errors using CSS and
3. Send an email to a specified email address using PHP.

It's as simple as that. If you like this implementation, you can build upon it with better CSS styling, you can add a dropdown combo box to select from different categories such as "Request for Quotation", "Feedback", "General Query", etc, you can integrate it into your CMS or framework... and so on.

##The Code
Below is the embedded code for you to quickly have a look at. You can also clone or download the contact.php file in this repository.
